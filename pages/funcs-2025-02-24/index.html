            <h1>Foundations of Cybersecurity at FaMAF</h1>
            <p>
                This is the webage for the course "Foundations of
                Cybersecurity," taking place in FaMAF from 2025-02-24 to
                2025-03-07.
            </p>
            <p>
                The course is given by Gilles Barthe
                (<a href="gbarthe.github.io">gbarthe.github.io</a>) and Santiago
                Arranz Olmos
                (<a href="sarranz.github.io">sarranz.github.io</a>), from
                MPI-SP.
                The classes are oriented to advanced computer science students,
                e.g., third year and up, but open to everyone.
                They are of interest to PhD students, researchers, and anyone
                interested in developing cybersecurity tools with solid
                theoretical foundations.
